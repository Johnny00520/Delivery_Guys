## Dependencies
- Redis
- MySQL

You need to have a MySQL server running on port 33306,
and a database called `eatnet`,
and a root MySQL user with no password. Alternatively,
you can edit `application.properties`, replacing
`spring.datasource.username` and `spring.datasource.password`
without your MySQL username and password.


````bash
mysql> create database eatnet;
````

The application will take care of creating tables when it starts up.

You also need to have Redis installed, and a Redis server running
in the background on port 6379.

````bash
redis-server &
````

Lastly, you also need to have JDK 1.7+ installed. Maven is not
necessary, as there is a `mvnw` script in the build directory
for you to use. If you do have Maven installed though,
that will also work.

Go to the build directory and execute:

````bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
````

or

````bash
mvn spring-boot:run
````

This should start the server on port 8443. You can then
open a web browser and go to `localhost:8443` to
use the website.
